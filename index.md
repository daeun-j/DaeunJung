<!--### Research Interests-->
My research interests focus on **federated and adaptive machine learning**, with an emphasis on understanding
how models learn, reason, and update their knowledge under **data heterogeneity and distribution shifts**.
I am particularly interested in settings where data are **non-IID, partially observed, and dynamically evolving**,
and how learning systems can remain reliable in such environments.

My current research interests include:

* Learning **representative and decision-oriented features** under data imbalance and distribution shifts
* Understanding and improving **reasoning behavior** in learning systems across heterogeneous clients
* Developing **unlearning-aware federated learning algorithms** to handle outdated, biased, or harmful information
