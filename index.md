<!--### Research Interests-->
My research interests primarily focus on **extracting representative features** to better understand learning mechanisms and improve inference, with a particular emphasis on **time-series data**.  
I am interested in learning scenarios where information is **partially observed** and data distributions **change over time**, and I study how meaningful information can be inferred under such conditions.

My research interests include:

* Extracting key features under **data distribution shifts**
* Understanding **causal relationships and dependencies** among variables in time-series data
* Adapting **federated learning** frameworks to overcome data imbalance and heterogeneity in time-series settings
